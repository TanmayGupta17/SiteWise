When an iterable object is passed as an argument to the built-in function iter(), it returns an iterator for the object. This iterator is good for one pass over the set of values. When using iterables, it is usually not necessary to call iter() or deal with iterator objects yourself. The for statement does that automatically for you, creating a temporary unnamed variable to hold the iterator for the duration of the loop.

A slice is created using the subscript notation, [] with colons between numbers when several are given, such as in variable_name[1:3:5]. The bracket (subscript) notation uses slice objects internally. soft deprecated¶A soft deprecated API should not be used in new code, but it is safe for already existing code to use it. The API remains documented and tested, but will not be enhanced further. Soft deprecation, unlike normal deprecation, does not plan on removing the API and will not emit warnings.

The strong reference is taken by calling Py_INCREF() when the reference is created and released with Py_DECREF() when the reference is deleted.

To store or transfer a string, it needs to be serialized as a sequence of bytes. Serializing a string into a sequence of bytes is known as “encoding”, and recreating the string from the sequence of bytes is known as “decoding”.

See also binary file for a file object able to read and write bytes-like objects. thread state¶The information used by the CPython runtime to run in an OS thread.

Thread states from multiple interpreters may be bound to the same thread, but only one can be attached in that thread at any given moment.

While they don’t provide any functionality not available with single-quoted strings, they are useful for a number of reasons. They allow you to include unescaped single and double quotes within a string and they can span multiple lines without the use of the continuation character, making them especially useful when writing docstrings. type¶The type of a Python object determines what kind of object it is; every object has a type.

Buffer instances are also JavaScript <Uint8Array> and <TypedArray> instances. All <TypedArray> methods are available on Buffers. There are, however, subtle incompatibilities between the Buffer API and the <TypedArray> API. In particular: While TypedArray.prototype.slice() creates a copy of part of the TypedArray, Buffer.prototype.slice() creates a view over the existing Buffer without copying. This behavior can be surprising, and only exists for legacy compatibility. TypedArray.prototype.subarray() can be used to achieve the behavior of Buffer.prototype.slice() on both Buffers and other TypedArrays and should be preferred. buf.toString() is incompatible with its TypedArray",

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection: # Create a sample collection users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore': 'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'} # Strategy: Iterate over a copy for user, status in users.copy().items(): if status == 'inactive': del users[user] # Strategy: Create a new collection active_users = {} for user, status in users.items(): if status == 'active': active_users[user] = status 4.3.

It generates arithmetic progressions: >>> for i in range(5): ... print(i) ... 0 1 2 3 4 The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’): >>> list(range(5, 10)) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] >>> list(range(0, 10, 3)) [0, 3, 6, 9] >>> list(range(-10, -100, -30)) [-10, -40, -70] To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len() as follows: >>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little',",

It is an object which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really make the list, thus saving space.

As the loop executes, it will run a sequence like if/if/if/else. The if is inside the loop, encountered a number of times. If the condition is ever true, a break will happen. If the condition is never true, the else clause outside the loop will execute. When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it does with that of if statements: a try statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs.

There are three forms, which can be combined. 4.9.1. Default Argument Values¶ The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that can be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to allow. For example: def ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'): while True: reply =",

Intermezzo: Coding Style¶ Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about coding style. Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that. For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style.

Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you: Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs. 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out. Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters. This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays. Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions. When possible, put comments on a line of their own. Use docstrings. Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4). Name",

Using Lists as Stacks¶ The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use append(). To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index. For example: >>> stack = [3, 4, 5] >>> stack.append(6) >>> stack.append(7) >>> stack [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] >>> stack.pop() 7 >>> stack [3, 4, 5, 6] >>> stack.pop() 6 >>> stack.pop() 5 >>> stack [3, 4] 5.1.2.

Using Lists as Queues¶ It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is the first element retrieved (“first-in, first-out”); however, lists are not efficient for this purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one). To implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends. For example: >>> from collections import deque >>> queue = deque([\"Eric\", \"John\", \"Michael\"]) >>> queue.append(\"Terry\") # Terry arrives >>> queue.append(\"Graham\") # Graham arrives >>> queue.popleft() # The first to arrive now leaves",

List Comprehensions¶ List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like: >>> squares = [] >>> for x in range(10): ... squares.append(x**2) ... >>> squares [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] Note that this creates (or overwrites) a",

We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using: squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10))) or, equivalently: squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)] which is more concise and readable. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal: >>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y] [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2,",

The del statement¶ There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement. This differs from the pop() method which returns a value. The del statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice). For example: >>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5] >>> del a[0] >>> a [1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5] >>> del a[2:4] >>> a [1,",

We’ll find other uses for del later. 5.3. Tuples and Sequences¶ We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance: >>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' >>> t[0]",

Dictionaries¶ Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or",

You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend(). It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.

If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. Extracting a value for a non-existent key by subscripting (d[key]) raises a KeyError. To avoid getting this error when trying to access a possibly non-existent key, use the get() method instead, which returns None (or a specified default value) if the key is not in the dictionary. Performing list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d) instead).

Comparing Sequences and Other Types¶ Sequence objects typically may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted.

On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right. The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true.
